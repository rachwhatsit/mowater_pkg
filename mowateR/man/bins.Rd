\title{Vegetation Bin Filter Experiment}

\description{
The \code{bins} data set comes from the Arizona Bureau of Reclamation, who
operated 7 pilot-scale vertical flow treatment wetlands (VFTW)
systems used to identify the best treatment configuration for
a reverse osmosis brine system. Grab samples were obtained intermittently
between 10/20/2010 and 9/19/2017 for each treatment train (``bin").
Influent and effluent samples were analyzed onsite for conductivity,
dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), pH, and
temperature. A subset of those samples was sent for offsite
analysis, including total dissolved solids (TDS), sulfate, chloride,
metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved
organic carbon (DOC).

\format{
A data frame with 3414 rows and 29 columns. The variables include an id to specify bin, a Date variable, and numerous analysis variables like temperature and chemical components.
